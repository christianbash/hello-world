Minecraft, it's no timelapse
I spend week after week but my times strapped
I construct the building that I'm layin' in
Brick by brick its cavin' in
The Creeper is near
I can hear the explosion
Rattle the structure
Foundation eroding
Diamond swords just turn to rust
The mobs swarmin' in
I gotta taste of dust
Survival of the fittest
Isle of the wicked
Gotta stay proficient
I will not be ended
Enderman imminent
Patiently waiting
For me to slip up
I am the sky
I am the haze
I am the biome
Give life from the raysI am the sky
I am the haze
I am the biome
Give life from the rays
And make peace with the eyesThey will never phase me
Pickaxe will send me to heaven
I'm building building never stopping til I get it
I'm in it to win it killin' em, hitting em
I don't think they know who I am
Came from the Nether
Arose from the grave, they will know my name
They will know my pain, when I end the game
Cannot be contained, I sip a splash, I unleash the wrath
I've ascended and I'm never going back
